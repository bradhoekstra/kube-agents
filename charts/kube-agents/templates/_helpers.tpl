The namespace to open OTLP egress to, for the LiteLLM NetworkPolicy.

A namespaceSelector cannot be derived at reconcile time the way the agent's endpoint can:
it has to be right when the policy is applied. So it comes from telemetry.collectorNamespace
when given, and otherwise from the endpoint host, which is a cluster-local Service name in
the case this feature exists for (<svc>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local, or the shortened <svc>.<ns>).

Anything else — an external vendor endpoint, a bare hostname — fails the render, but only
when litellm.otel is on. Silently falling back to gke-managed-otel would emit a policy that
blocks the very collector the user just configured, and the symptom would be zero spans
with a green install. With litellm.otel off (the default) there is no LiteLLM exporter for
the policy to block, so failing the whole install over an egress rule nothing uses would
punish a user who only meant to repoint the agents.
