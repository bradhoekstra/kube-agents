# Boskos lease heartbeat daemon
# ==============================================================================
# POSTs the Boskos client's /update call every
# BOSKOS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS so the lease's LastUpdate stays fresh and
# the reaper (ranch.Reset, ~5m window) does not reclaim the project while a
# CI phase still runs. Covers what the Prow wrapper's own heartbeat does not
# — teardown, where a slow sweep outliving the lease turned the final
# release into a 401 (2026-09-01, kube-agents-evals-4).
#
# Liveness travels on its own channel: per-beat lines go to
# BOSKOS_HEARTBEAT_LOG, stdout carries only start, ok<->fail transitions,
# and a stop summary. At the ~5m window a 30s cadence tolerates 9 missed
# beats, so a 3-minute hang (6 beats) keeps the lease; a pod frozen past the
# window loses it, which is the reclaim working as intended.
#
# Usage (backgrounded, killed by the caller's EXIT trap):
#   ./hack/boskos_heartbeat.sh & HEARTBEAT_PID=$!
#   trap 'kill "${HEARTBEAT_PID}" 2>/dev/null || true' EXIT
# If the caller dies without running that trap, the daemon notices at its
# next beat and stops itself (see the loop), so it cannot outlive the job.
#
# Disabled (single notice, exit 0) unless BOSKOS_HOST, BOSKOS_RESOURCE_NAME,
# and BOSKOS_OWNER_NAME are all set. Pool resource names are DNS-safe, so
# the query string needs no URL encoding.
#
# No command substitution anywhere in this file. bash 5.2 (every patch
# level; 5.1 and 5.3 are clean, and the Prow image and ubuntu-latest both
# run 5.2) runs a pending trap from inside the parser when a signal lands
# while it re-parses a $(...) or <(...) for expansion, and the parser's
# state leaks into the trap: either the trap string fails to parse
# ("trap: line 2: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `)'") and the
# signal is lost, or the enclosing command fails to parse and the shell
# exits 1 without running summary -- no stop line, no WARNING. The window
# is microseconds per beat. Builtins stand in instead: printf -v for date,
# `cmd | read -r var` under lastpipe for capture, read for /proc.
# tests/test_boskos_heartbeat.py rejects the construct. No `break` either:
# on every bash version a trapped signal that lands on a `break` out of a
# loop is dropped rather than deferred (5 of 1000 TERMs in a tight loop),
# so a loop here runs to its end.

set -uo pipefail
# The last command of a pipeline runs in this shell (job control is off in
# a script), so `cmd | read -r var` captures output without a $(...).
